## ✎⋆.ೃ࿔\*:･ *Odin Recipes* ࿐ ࿔\*:･ﾟ

This is my first project for The Odin Project Foundations module!

During this project I practiced setting up HTML files with different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, and linking to images.

I had a lot of fun looking through my favorite bookmarked recipes and deciding which three I wanted to include. Give them a try if you think they look yummy! 😋
