  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 small red onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1.5 tsp cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp adobo seasoning</li>
    <li>½ tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>½ tsp salt</li>
    <li>¼ tsp freshly cracked black pepper</li>
    <li>½ cup brown lentils, rinsed</li>
    <li>1 15oz. can black beans, drained & rinsed</li>
    <li>1 14.5oz. can fire roasted tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
    <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
    <li>¾ cup long grain white rice, rinsed</li>
    <li>½ cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Dice the red onion and mince the garlic. Add olive oil and onion to a large deep skillet
      over medium heat and sauté until onions are translucent, approximately 2-3 minutes. Add
      minced garlic and sauté an additional 30 seconds or until garlic is fragrant.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the cumin, chili powder, adobo, oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet, stir and
      toast spices for about 30 seconds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next add in the lentils, black beans, fire roasted tomatoes (with juices), corn, and
      vegetable broth. Stir everything to combine. Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat
      up to medium-high, and allow the mixture to come to a full boil. Once boiling,
      immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. This will allow
      the lentils to start cooking first before adding the rice.
    </li>
    <li>
      After 5 minutes, remove the lid and add the rice. Stir briefly just to evenly distribute
      the rice, cover with a lid, bring the skillet back to a boil, then reduce the heat again
      and simmer for 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      While the mixture is cooking, grate the cheddar cheese and slice the green onions.
    </li>
    <li>
      After 20 minutes, remove the skillet from the heat and let it rest, with the lid on,
      for 5 minutes. After it has rested, remove the lid, fluff the rice and gently stir to
      redistribute the veggies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Top the lentils and rice mixture with shredded cheese and sliced green onions. Serve
      with more of your favorite toppings and enjoy!
